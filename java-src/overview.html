A collection of extensions and utility routing to assist in writing tests for 
StreamBase applications.
<p/>
There are a few main classes which provide the lion's share of the flexibility
in this framework.  Most interactions will be centered around creating and
configuring these classes.
<li>{@link com.streambase.sbunit.ext.Matchers} provides factory routines for 
building up matchers.</li>
<li>{@link com.streambase.sbunit.ext.StreamMatcher} is the primary class used
to expect values on dequeuers.</li>
<li>{@link com.streambase.sbunit.ext.matchers.FieldBasedTupleMatcher} provides
a variety of routines to selectively ignore, require, and validate fields.</li>
